        <p>This pineapple fried rice with chicken is a Bangkok street food recipe I snagged on a recent trip there. When available, use fresh pineapple, and serve the rice in the hollowed pineapple shell. Enjoy.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 slices bacon, diced</li>
            <li>3 shallots, sliced</li>
            <li>4 ounces chicken breast, cut into small cubes</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons curry powder, divided</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil, or as needed (Optional)</li>
            <li>3 egg yolks, beaten</li>
            <li>3 cups cooked jasmine rice</li>
            <li>1 red Thai bird chile pepper, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons whole cilantro leaves</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons fish sauce</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon white sugar</li>
            <li>4 ounces tiger prawns, peeled and deveined</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped fresh pineapple</li>
            <li>3 green onions, finely chopped</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>Place bacon in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until crisp, about 10 minutes. Remove bacon with a slotted spoon onto a paper towel-lined plate; set aside. Reserve bacon drippings in the wok.</li>
        <li>Cook and stir shallots in bacon drippings over medium-high heat until fragrant and light brown, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir chicken into shallots and cook, without stirring, until browned on one side, 45 seconds to 1 minute; stir. Continue cooking until chicken is browned, about 1 minute. Add 2 teaspoons curry powder; stir until chicken is coated.</li>
        <li>Make a well in the center of chicken and pour oil into the center of the well; add egg yolks. Cook and stir egg yolks until set, 1 to 2 minutes. Add rice and stir, breaking up rice.</li>
        <li>Mix chile pepper, cilantro, soy sauce, remaining 2 teaspoons curry powder, fish sauce, and sugar into rice mixture; add shrimp and cook until shrimp is cooked through and pink, about 2 minutes. Fold pineapple, green onions, and bacon into rice mixture.</li>
        </ol>
